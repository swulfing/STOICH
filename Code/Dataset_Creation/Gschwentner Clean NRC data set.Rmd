### Code to tidy NRC data set following GitHub Guidelines

---
---

#### Guidelines
---
###### Major ions to include

- CHLORIDE
- SULFATE
- CALCIUM
- MAGNESIUM
- SODIUM
- POTASSIUM
- IRON
- MANGANESE

##### Forms of C,N,P

Naming conventions

- Total kjeldahl nitrogen == TKN
- Total particulate phosphorus == TPP
- Total carbon == TC
- NH4 == NH4 as N
- NH3 == NH3 as N
- NO2 == NO2 as N
- NO3 == NO3 as N

Conversion of N forms to N as N: Divide mass of species by atomic weight and multiply by atomic weight of N.

```{r N conversion table, include=F}

N <- tibble(
  Species = c("NH4", "NH3", "NO3", "NO2"), 
  "Atomic weight" = c(18.04, 17.031, 62.0049, 46.0055), 
  "Atomic weight N" = 14.0067 
)

```

The formula for the conversions of N species are as follows: `r glue("{NSpecies} / {AtomWeight} * {AtomWeightN}", NSpecies = N$Species, AtomWeight = N$"Atomic weight", AtomWeightN = N$"Atomic weight N")`. Note: this is not needed for NO~3~^-^ as already converted to NO~3~^-^ as N.

DOC, NO3 as N and PO4 as P are already standardised.


##### Other things

- TEMP = deg_C
- SP_COND = uS/cm
- DO = mg/L
- CHLA = mg/L
- pH

##### Data upload.

When you are finished, save the new dataset as "NAME_1.csv" in the Data/other_vars_datasets folder, i.e., do not overwrite the dataset that is in there, rather make a new one, e.g., EU_1.csv.

```{r Load data save locally and re-import, include=F}

# nrc <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swulfing/STOICH.Aim1/main/Data/other_vars_datasets/NRC.csv")
# write_delim(nrc, "local_data/nrc_raw.csv", delim = ",")
nrc <- read_csv("local_data/nrc_raw.csv")

# Had to manually replace Âµ with u in data set...
```


```{r Overview of data, echo = F}

colnames(nrc)

unique(nrc$VARIABLE) # Yikes!!!!

# Copy of data set.
nrc_edit<- nrc %>%
  mutate(param_units = paste0(VARIABLE, " ", UNIT))

### Do not run, this just creates a headache.
# dat_edits %>%
#   group_by(param_units) %>%
#   mutate(n = n()) %>%
#   kable() %>%
#   kable_classic(full_width = F, position = "float_left")

# Do not run.
sort(unique(nrc_edit$param_units))


```

N.B.!!!! For the NRC data set following parameters have issues:
- Calcium: doesn't exist in data set.
- Chloride: only dissolved fraction present.
- Sodium: only dissolved fraction present.
- Potassium: only dissolved fraction present.
- Magneisum is the sum of the particulate and dissolved fractions.
- Assuming following vars are already converted to N based on names and prior information: AMMONIA DISSOLVED MG/L N, 
- Particulate P calculated as TP - Dissolved P

Lots of dissolved N that I did not include in data tidying.
