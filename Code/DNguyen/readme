DNguyen contains all code for analyses and estimated model objects.

The subfolders:
/models contains fitted models
/data contains data used to fit models

# data processing and model fitting

* build_new_cnp.R builds data set for analysis. Computes median of medians and saves to /data.
* fit_ols.rmd runs OLS analyses
* fit_cnp_models.R fits all SVC models. fitted models are saved in /models
* fit_gam_cnp.rmd fits all GAM models. Fitted models are saved in /models

# post model fitting 

* calc_svc_sd.R calculates predictions and standard errors for individual svc to make maps. Saved in DNguyen folder.
* make_gam_derivative_plots.Rmd calculates slopes and plots these for GAM models.
* posterior_simulation_prediction.Rmd  Preliminary work to compute credible intervals for "inflection points" from GAM prediction. Code is incomplete.

# data visualization

* interactive_CNP_plot.Rmd produces interactive plots of CNP data. Output is in google drive.
* joint_dist_cp.Rmd visualizes the joint distributions of CNP data. Output is in google drive.
* data_viz_svc.Rmd visualize results of SVC models. Includes diagnostic plots. Output is in google drive.
* make_svc_maps.Rmd makes improved maps of SVC. Output is in google drive.
* make_prediction_plots.Rmd calculate and plot regression curves. Output in google drive. Save outputs loose in DNguyen folder, named things like pred_nutrient_quantile.RDS.
