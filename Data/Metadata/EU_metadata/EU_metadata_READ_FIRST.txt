You should be able to determine everyting you need from the dataset because they are good at reporting units. For example,
units that are written as mg{NH3}/L means this result is reported as as ammonia rather than as nitrogen. 

If you need more info, the metadata is located in online tables:
 ----units info: http://dd.eionet.europa.eu/vocabulary/wise/Uom/view?page=2#vocabularyConceptResults
 ----parameters info: http://dd.eionet.europa.eu/vocabulary/wise/ObservedProperty/

See the spreadsheet for more links. But the two above should be everything you need.
