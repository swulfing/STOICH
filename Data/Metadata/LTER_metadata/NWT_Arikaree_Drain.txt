    This is a summary of major ion concentrations for stream water samples collected from the stream draining the Arikaree Cirque. Sampling location varied from the channel at the lip of the cirque, where it is first exposed by snowmelt, at the beginning of the season to the outlet from the pond at the foot of the glacier (usually around early July).

      The documentation section of this file was developed from the NWT LTER Data Directory (Symphony files DDABSTRA.WR1, DDDOCUME.WR1, DDMASTER.WR1, DDVARIAB.WR1; last updated 16 December 1991) by Susan Kindig and Rick Ingersoll in early November 1992. Additional information for the documentation section, as well as the header and data sections were supplied by Nel Caine on 12 February 1993. Data were compiled in January 1993 by Nel Caine from earlier files for individual years.[RCI, 15 February 1993] This file was put under sccs control on 30 March 1993. See the appropriate history file for additional log information.[RCI 30 March 1993] Truncation of the final 0 had occurred for October dates when the original data were saved from spreadsheet software and these zeroes were replaced on 23 November 1993.[RCI 23 November 1993] Data for 1984-1991 were reformatted in order to be consistent with post-1991 data formats on 2 May 1994. The variables, comments, and header sections were modified accordingly.[RCI 2 May 1994] Data for 1993 were appended to the data section on 4 May 1994.[RCI 4 May 1994] On 11 July 1994, it was discovered that the spring 1994 conversions from mg NO3/L to ueq NO3/L for 1984-1991 data had been incorrectly done (mg/L values were multiplied by 61.3 instead of 16.39). The 1984-1991 data were extracted from this file, a script to correct the error was run on the extracted data, and the corrected data were used to replace the erroneous data on 12 July 1994. [RCI 12 July 1994] Data for 1992 were provided by Chris Seibold on 16 November 1994; these data were processed and inserted into the data section on 17 November 1994.[RCI 17 November 1994] All data for 920709 were converted to missing because all values were deemed to be too low (presumably because the sample was inadvertently diluted) by Mark Williams and Nel Caine.[RCI 30 January 1995] Data for 1994 were appended to the data section on 12 February 1996. Columns for total and dissolved N and P were also added to the data section on 12 February 1996.[MAH 12 February 1996] Data for 1995 were appended to the data section on 26 September 1996.[MAH 26 September 1996] Data for 1996 were appended to the data section on 3 September 1997. Columns for particulate, inorganic, and dissolved organic N and P as well as for PO4--- were also added to the data section on that date.[MAH 3 September 1997] The investigator contact information was updated on 9 June 1999.[MAH 9 June 1999] Added stream water quality to keywords section on 21 July 1999.[MAH 21 July 1999] Data for 1997 and 1998 were appended to the data section on 31 August 2000.[MAH 31 August 2000] Data for 1999 appended to the data section.[TMA 23 April 2001] Data for 2000 were appended to the data section on 05 November 2001.[TMA 05 November 2001] The values for total P, dissolved P, dissolved organic N, particulate N, and inorganic N were determined to be incorrect for 1997, 1998, and 1999. The values were corrected on 10 June 2003.[TMA 10 June 2003] Data for 2001 were appended to the data section.[TMA 03 November 2003] Data for 2002 were appended to the data section.[TMA 05 November 2003] Data for 2003 were appended to the data section.[TMA 22 March 2005] Four new columns were added to the data file, 31-O18, 32-TOC, 33-DOC, 34-POC. Data for 2004 were appended to the data section.[TMA 25 May 2005] Data for 2005 were appended to the data section.[TMA 26 October 2006] Data for 1991-2005 were reinserted into the data section due to several column errors and the fact that the Kiowa Lab had re-run many samples.  Data for 2006 were appended to the data section.[TMA 23 May 2007] Data for 2007 to 2009 were appended to the data section. Edited title and keywords for inclusion in inorganic nutrients data sets.[HCH 21 April 2010] Data for 2010 and 2011 were appended to the data section. Dates were reformatted to yyyy-mm-dd; absence of value changed to NP (not performed); variables, keywords, and cols updated to reflect all variables in the data.[HCH 29 June 2013] Data for 2012 to 2014 were appended to the data file. Labels, units, and definitions were edited. [HCH 22 December 2015] Minor text editing was conducted.[HCH 22 April 2016] LTER_site column was added.[HCH 25 April 2018][2014 data updated and 2015 data appended; unit definitions changed to standards; contents quoted to accommodate commas in comments SCE 23 October 2018]Niwot metadata converted via script to EML[SCE 2018-10-23] Data for 2016, 2017, and 2018 appended [ATW 1 April 2019]. Leading 0's added to 3 digit times, negative values for DOP, IN and DON replaced with 'u' in all years; negative value for specific analytes in 2013-2018 replaced with lab-reported mdl for that year.[ATW 23 April 2019] Data for 2019 appended [ATW 16 Feb 2021]. Data for 2020 appended [ATW 10 March 2021].

          Data for 1984-1991 were originally provided by Nel Caine as space-delimited ASCII files saved from a 1-2-3 spreadsheet and the later data sets were provided by the Kiowa Lab manager in space-delimited ASCII files saved from a 1-2-3 spreadsheet. The 2 formats differed in terms of units, number of columns, and column order.
          The times during at which samples were collected were not provided in the data for 1982-1991, although some of this information could be retrieved from the original field notebooks of Nel Caine. Similarly, charge balances were not provided with the earlier data but could be calculated from the other data.
          Total and dissolved N and P were measured beginning in 1994. "Empty" columns were added to data from previous years in order to maintain a cosistent format.
          Particulate, inorganic, and dissolved organic N and P as well as PO4--- were measured beginning in 1996. Some of these parameters had been measured on several of the 1995 samples, so all the data for 1995 were reprocessed to include these measurements and "empty" columns were added to data from previous years in order to maintain a cosistent format.
          A note on the laboratory print out indicated that a repeat NH4 anlysis resulted in a value of 17.18 ueq/L for the sample collected on 940922. The charge balance was calculated as (cation sum - anion sum)/(cation sum + anion sum).
          The sampling site is at 3785 m elevation and represents a drainage area of 9.2 ha.
          Concentrations below the detection limit are shown as zero.
          A comment on the lab printout noted that the PN and PP for the sample collected on 990729 were not valid, an unfiltered aliquot was not frozen. The NV was replaced with a missing value.
          Dissolved organic C was measured starting in 1998. Total organic C and particulate organic C were measured starting in 2002.
          Delta 18O was measured starting in 1998. Units were originally reported as "ppm", but the correct units are "per mill" (parts per thousand) as confirmed by Chris Seibold (17 November 2011). Delta deuterium, the standard deviations of delta 18O and delta deuterium values, and deuterium excess were measured starting in 2007.
          The missing value indicator is one of the following codes:
          DNS=Data Not Submitted
          EQCL=Exceeds Quality Control Limits
          N/A=Not Applicable
          NP=Not Performed
          NSS=No Sample Submitted
          NV=Not Valid
          QNS=Quantity Not Sufficient
          Concentrations below the detection limit are shown as zero prior to 2007 and "u" subsequently.
          Note: columns for acidity, alkalinity, and tritium are present in the data set for consistency with other stream water chemistry data sets. Measurements for these variables were not performed for this data set.

          measure of hydrogen ion concentration
        
        
          microsiemens per centimeter; used for concentration of ionized dissoved solids
        
        
          concentration of charge (on dissolved ions). A single ultiplier to SI is not possible; since conversion includes valence of ion; which can vary
        
        
          commonly used for concentration of some chemical constituents of natural water bodies; e.g.; nutrients. It has the same magnitude as micromolar; but micromolar can only be used for a dissolved constituent
