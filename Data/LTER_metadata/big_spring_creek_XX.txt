Dataset Abstract

	These data were collected by Stephen Michael Powers and collaborators for his Ph.d.
				research, documented in his dissertation: River Nutrient Uptake and Transport Across
				Extremes in Channel Form and Drainage Characteristics. A major goal of this research was to
				 better understand how ecosystem form and landscape setting dictate aquatic biogeochemical
				functioning and elemental transport through rivers. To achieve this goal, major and minor
				ions were measured in both northern and southern Wisconsin streams located in a variety of
				land use settings. In total, 27 different streams were sampled at 104 different stations
				(multiple stations per system) from both groundwater and surface water sources. Organic and
				inorganic carbon and nitrogen pools were also measured in northern and southern Wisconsin
				streams. The streams that were sampled in northern Wisconsin flow through wetland
				ecosystems. In sampling such streams, the goal was to better understand how wetland
				ecosystems influence river nutrient deliveries. There is a large amount of stream chemistry
				data for Big Spring Creek, WI; where the influence of a small reservoir on solute
				transportation and transformation was studied in an agricultural watershed. All stream
				chemistry data is incorporated in a single data file, Water Chemistry 2005-2011. While the
				data is not included in the dissertation, a sediment core study  was also done in the small
				reservoir and channel of Big Spring (BS) Creek, WI. The results of this study are featured
				in three data tables: BS Creek Sediment Core Analysis, BS Creek Sediment Core Chemistry, and
				BS Creek Longitudinal Profile. Finally, two data tables list the geospatial information of
				sampling sites for stream chemistry and sediment coring in Big Spring Creek.
