    Remote sensing approaches that could identify species of submerged
    aquatic vegetation (SAV) and measure their extent in lake littoral
    zones would greatly enhance their study and management, especially
    if they can provide faster or more accurate results than traditional
    field methods. Remote sensing with multispectral sensors can provide
    this capability, but SAV identification with this technology must
    address the challenges of light extinction in aquatic environments
    where chlorophyll, dissolved organic carbon, and suspended minerals
    can affect water clarity and the strength of the sensed light
    signal. Here, we present environmental data collected to support a
    study using an unmanned aerial system (UAS)-enabled methodology to
    identify the extent of the invasive SAV species
    Myriophyllum spicatum (Eurasian watermilfoil,
    or EWM) in the Les Cheneaux Islands area of northwestern Lake Huron,
    Michigan, USA. Data collected includes water chemistry (nitrogen,
    phosphorus, carbon, suspended solids, chlorophyll a), light
    profiles, and submerged aquatic vegetation characteristics including
    cover, species dominance using aquatic vegetation survey methods
    (AVAS), and biomass.

    At each site during each visit, we collected a set of standard water
    chemistry and light data to quantify the CPA values at each site and
    characterize the sites as having lower or higher water clarity.
    Primary data collected included the following:
  
          
    The method we used for calculating chlorophyll data was based on
    standard methods (APHA 2005), including collecting water into 1-L
    plastic bottles and storing samples on ice until returning to the
    lab within eight hours. Water was filtered through 47-mm-diameter
    0.7-µm glass fiber filters, with filters wrapped in aluminum foil
    and frozen at -20°C until analysis within a month. Chl-a filters
    were extracted in 95% ethanol and analyzed spectrophotometrically
    following APHA method 10200H.2.b/EPA method 446.0, with calculations
    following Nusch 1980.
  
          
    We used a Li-Cor LI-193 SA spherical underwater quantum sensor with
    a LI-1400 datalogger (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA), with light
    intensity values recorded above the surface, immediately below the
    surface, and every 0.5 m until the bottom was reached, with the
    bottom depth also being recorded (Wetzel and Likens 2013). We also
    recorded Secchi disk transparency depth at each site.
  
          
    For TSS, we used APHA method 2540B (APHA 2005) to calculate the mass
    of total suspended solids (TSS) in mg/L. Water was collected into
    1-L plastic bottles and stored on ice until returning to the lab
    within eight hours. A well-mixed, measured volume of a water sample,
    typically 750–1000 mL, was filtered through a pre-weighed
    47-mm-diameter 0.7-µm glass fiber filter. The filter was heated to
    constant mass at 104 ± 1º C and then weighed. The mass of material
    captured on the filter divided by the water volume filtered is equal
    to the TSS.
  
          
    For DOC, we collected water samples in 60-mL Nalgene bottles.
    Samples were filtered through 0.45-μm membrane filters and frozen at
    -20°C until analysis. DOC samples were acidified with hydrochloric
    acid and quantified using a Shimadzu TOC-VCSN (Shimadzu Scientific
    Instruments, Columbia, Maryland).
  
          
    The depth to EWM was based on visual estimation of the field team to
    the top of visible EWM growth at each site. The depth to bottom was
    measured as part of the SDT measurements by dropping the Secchi disc
    all the way to the bottom.
  
          
    Percent open water was also based on visual estimation of the field
    team, with open water defined as areas with no emergent or submerged
    aquatic vegetation present within the visible water column at each
    site.
  
          
    Field sampling of vegetation type and density was completed through
    visual estimates, rake tosses, and rake twists, with results
    recorded on standardized field sheets. Visual estimate methods and
    percent vegetation by sampling location were described in Brooks et
    al. 2019 and based on the Michigan Department of Environmental
    Quality guidance of 2005 (MDEQ 2005). Visual estimates were made by
    an experienced aquatic vegetation expert, representing an
    approximately 3-m radius. In 2016, visual estimates were made in
    approximately the center of each sampling site and recorded on a
    field data sheet, and location coordinates were recorded with a
    Trimble GeoExplorer GPS with sub-meter accuracy. In 2017 and 2018,
    three marker buoys were placed in the water around each site and
    three visual estimates were made per buoy in different directions,
    with locations recorded with the same Trimble GPS and visual
    estimate data recorded on field sheets.
  
          
    Rake twists provided a more benthic-oriented sampling of vegetation
    types than rake tosses. For rake tosses, a rake end was tied to a
    rope, thrown approximately 10 m and dragged back towards the boat.
    Rake fullness was scored on a four-point scale (1, 2, 3, or 4 =
    found, sparse, common, dense) based on a visual estimation, and
    vegetation types were recorded by approximate predominance. With
    rake twists, a rake end mounted on a two-meter pole was thrust
    downwards into the water immediately off the side of the research
    vessel (Johnson and Newman 2011). Vegetation caught in the rake was
    deposited in buckets for sorting and identification, including
    predominance on a five-point scale. The macrophytes from each twist
    rake sample were separated and identified to species using Fasset et
    al. 2006 and Skawinski 2014. Species of Chara
    and Elodea were identified to genus. EWM and
    hybrid EWM (M. spicatum x sibiricum) were
    grouped together, as they are not distinguishable in the field and
    are difficult to separate (Parkinson et al. 2011). The samples were
    dried for 48 h at 60°C to determine dry weight (see Van Goethem et
    al. 2020 for additional detail).
