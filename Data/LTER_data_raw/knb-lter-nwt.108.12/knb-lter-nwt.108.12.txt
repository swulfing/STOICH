      The documentation section of this file was developed from the NWT LTER Data Directory (Symphony files DDABSTRA.WR1, DDDOCUME.WR1, DDMASTER.WR1, DDVARIAB.WR1; last updated 16 December 1991) by Susan Kindig and Rick Ingersoll in early November 1992. Additional information for the documentation section, as well as the header and data sections were supplied by Nel Caine on 12 February 1993. Data were compiled in January 1993 by Nel Caine from earlier files for individual years.[RCI, 15 February 1993] This file was put under sccs control on 30 March 1993. See the appropriate history file for additional log information.[RCI 30 March 1993]Data for 1982-1991 were reformatted in order to be consistent with post-1991 data formats on 2 May 1994. The variables, comments, and header sections were modified accordingly.[RCI 2 May 1994] Data for 1993 were appended to the data section on 4 May 1994.[RCI 4 May 1994] Comments were added to the documentation section with regard to late April/early May 1994 repeated analyses on 1993 samples. The conductance value for the 930805 sample, 16.60 for initial determination, was replaced (with 8.48) in the data section based on these repeated analyses.[RCI 17 May 1994] On 11 July 1994, it was discovered that the spring 1994 conversions from mg NO3/L to ueq NO3/L for 1982-1991 data have been incorrectly done (mg/L values were multiplied by 61.3 instead of 16.39). The 1982-1991 data were extracted from this file, a script to correct the error was run on the extracted data, and the corrected data were used to replace the erroneous data on 12 July 1994.[RCI 12 July 1994] Data from 1992, as well as 1 record from 1993, were provided by Chris Seibold on 16 November 1994; these data were processed and inserted into the data section on 17 November 1994.[RCI 17 November 1994] Several instances of questionable data were converted to missing data (see comments section for particulars) on 30 January 1995.[RCI 30 January 1995] Data for 1994 were appended to the data section on 12 February 1996. Columns for total and dissolved N and P were also added to the data section on 12 February 1996.[MAH 12 February 1996] Data for 1995 were appended to the data section on 26 September 1996.[MAH 26 September 1996] Data for 1996 were appended to the data section on 3 September 1997. Columns for particulate, inorganic, and dissolved organic N and P as well as for PO4--- were also added to the data section on that date.[MAH 3 September 1997] The investigator contact information was updated on 9 June 1999.[MAH 9 June 1999] Added stream water quality to keywords section on 21 July 1999.[MAH 21 July 1999] Data for 1997 and 1998 were appended to the data section on 31 August 2000.[MAH 31 August 2000] Data for 1999 were appended to the data section on 23 April 2001.[TMA 23 April 2001] Data for 2000 were appended to the data section on 05 November 2001.[TMA 05 November 2001] The values for total P, dissolved P, dissolved organic N, particulate N, and inorganic N were determined to be incorrect for 1997, 1998, and 1999. The values were corrected on 10 June 2003.[TMA 10 June 2003] Data for 2001 were appended to the data section.[TMA 03 November 2003] Data for 2002 were appended to the data section/[TMA 05 November 2003] Data for 2003 were appended to the data section.[TMA 22 March 2005] Four new columns were added to the data file, 31-O18, 32-TOC, 33-DOC, 34-POC. Data for 2004 were appended to the data section.[TMA 24 May 2005] Data for 2005 were appended to the data section.[TMA 26 October 2006] Data for 1991 through 2005 were removed and reinserted due to Calcium being re-run and updated results.[TMA 25 January 2007] Data for 1991-2005 were reinserted into the data section due to several column errors and the fact that the Kiowa Lab had re-run many samples.  Data for 2006 were appended to the data section.[TMA 23 May 2007] Data for 930129 was removed due to being a misprint.[TMA 10 July 2007] Edited title and keywords for inclusion in core inorganic nutrients data sets.[HCH 21 April 2010] Dates were reformatted to yyyy-mm-dd; absence of value changed to NP (not performed); variables, keywords, and cols updated to reflect all variables in the data. [HCH 13 June 2013] Data for 2012 to 2014 were appended to the data file. Labels, units, and definitions edited. [HCH 26 December 2015] Minor text editing was conducted.[HCH 22 April 2016] Two samples were transferred from the GL5 data set to this data set based on information from Nel Caine: 2013-08-01 13:25 and 2014-09-25 13:15.[HCH 15 September 2017] LTER_site column was added.[HCH 25 April 2018][2014 data updated and 2015 data appended; unit definitions changed to standards; contents quoted to accommodate commas in comments, 'trace' values changed to 'u' where applicable SCE 23 October 2018]Niwot metadata converted via script to EML[SCE 2018-10-23] Data for 2016, 2017, and 2018 appended [ATW 1 April 2019]. Leading 0's added to 3 digit times, negative values for DOP, IN and DON replaced with 'u' in all years; negative value for specific analytes in 2013-2018 replaced with lab-reported mdl for that year.[ATW 23 April 2019] Data for 2019 appended [ATW 16 Feb 2021]. Data for 2020 appended [ATW 9 March 2021].

          Data for 1982-1991 were originally provided by Nel Caine as space-delimited ASCII files saved from a 1-2-3 spreadsheet and the later data sets were provided by the Kiowa Lab manager in space-delimited ASCII files saved from a 1-2-3 spreadsheet. The 2 formats differed in terms of units, number of columns, and column order.
          The times during at which samples were collected were not provided in the data for 1982-1991, although some of this information could be retrieved from the original field notebooks of Nel Caine. Similarly, charge balances were not provided with the earlier data but could be calculated from the other data.
          The charge balance was calculated as (cation sum - anion sum)/(cation sum + anion sum).
          Concentrations below the detection limit are shown as zero.
          A 24 April 1994 memorandum from Nel Caine to Chris Seibold regarding the 911128 sample stated "Sample seems to be contaminated by KCl - someone put a pH electrode in it?"
          The following 2 records were included in the file containing the 1992 data and represent redetermination of 2 1991 samples. A portion or all of these data may or may not ultimately be used to replace the original determinations. Column formats are identical to those described in the header section below: GREEN LAKE 4,911128,1045,6.69,,,0.20,,,23.03,33.06,218.91,,,,31.51,275.21,, GREEN LAKE 4,911226,1120,6.96,,84.39,0.11,,165.17,26.32,34.36,13.30,8.24,30.29, 108.26,37.31,239.27,231.18,0.02
          The following notes were provided by Chris Seibold (1 November 1994) on a hard-copy printout of the 1992 data:
          For 911128 sample - 1045 Sample seems to be contaminated with KCl. QNS (quantity not sufficient) to repeat.
          For 920709 sample - Conductance and ion concentrations are low for some NS (missing) data.
          A 24 April 1994 memorandum from Nel Caine to Chris Seibold regarding the 930301 sample indicated that "NO3 and SO4 are both high". The analyses were repeated in late April/early May 1994 and provided a NO3 concentration of 32.30 ueq/L and a SO4 concentration of 115.99 ueq/L.
          A 24 April 1994 memorandum from Nel Caine to Chris Seibold regarding the 930805 sample suggested that "conductance affected by age?" because it was "7.88" "in field". The conductance was redetermined in late April/early May 1994 and yielded a value of 8.48 which was then substituted for the value (16.60) of the initial determination.
          The sampling site is at 3550 m elevation and represents a drainage area of 220.9 ha.
          A 28 January 1995 email message from Mark Williams recommended that the acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) for 841121 be converted to missing data because it was excessively high (notes from individuals (Furbish and Warburton) indicated that the sample "looked dirty"), ANC values for the period 910919 to 911128 be converted to missing data because they were an order of magnitude too low, and that all data for 920709 be deleted (converted to missing data) because all values were too low (presumably the sample was inadvertently diluted. These were implemented 30 January 1995.
          Total and dissolved N and P were measured beginning in 1994. "Empty" columns were added to data from previous years in order to maintain a cosistent format.
          Particulate, inorganic, and dissolved organic N and P as well as PO4--- were measured beginning in 1996. Some of these parameters had been measured on several of the 1995 samples, so all the data for 1995 were reprocessed to include these measurements and "empty" columns were added to data from previous years in order to maintain a cosistent format.
          Sample bottles for the first records for 941013, 941027, and 941124 were soaked in 10% HCL solution, while sample bottles for the second records for these dates were soaked in deionized water.
          The hard copy laboratory print out indicated that a repeat conductance anylisis for the 940502 sample produced a value of 17.69 uS/cm.
          The lab printout indicated that melt water above lake ice was collected for the 990513 and 990520 samples.
          Delta 18O was measured starting in 1998. Units were originally reported as "ppm", but the correct units are "per mill" (parts per thousand) as confirmed by Chris Seibold (17 November 2011). Total organic C and particulate organic C were added in 2002. Delta deuterium was measured starting in 2007 and Tritium was measured starting in 2009.
          The missing value indicator is one of the following codes:
          DNS=Data Not Submitted
          EQCL=Exceeds Quality Control Limits
          N/A=Not Applicable
          NP=Not Performed
          NSS=No Sample Submitted
          NV=Not Valid
          QNS=Quantity Not Sufficient
          Concentrations below the detection limit are shown as zero prior to 2007 and "u" subsequently.
