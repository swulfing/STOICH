      Raw data for 2005-2013 were compiled from excel spreadsheets by HCH [date unknown]. Metadata were compiled based on parallel information from sadd007solu, and columns for LTER_site and local_site were added [ATW 16 December 2018]. Data for 2016, 2017, and 2018 were appended [ATW 2 April 2019]. Leading 0s added to 3 digit times, negative values for DOP, IN and DON replaced with u in all years; negative value for specific analytes in 2013-2018 replaced with lab-reported mdl for that year.[ATW 23 April 2019]. Niwot metadata converted via script to EML[ATW 2019-04-23] Data for 2019 appended [ATW 16 Feb 2021]. Data for 2020 appended [ATW 10 March 2021].

          The Saddle stream is the stream at the bottom of the saddle catchment, draining the Saddle into the Green Lakes valley (southward). These samples are usually taken at the wooden weir where flow records are maintained, i.e. about 40 m upstream of the Green Lakes road. Surface  waters were collected  as grab samples at daily to weekly sampling frequency at the lower portion of the saddle stream which is below Niwot Ridge in the Boulder County Watershed. Water samples were collected in polyethylene bottles (following the protocol of Campbell et al. 2000), soaked with deionized water overnight, and then rinsed copiously five times; bottles were further rinsed three times with sample water at the time of collection. Samples were collected ~10 cm below the water surface in turbulent areas where the water column was well mixed. All water samples were transported the same day as collection to our wet chemistry laboratory (Kiowa lab) and treated the same as melted snow samples. Samples for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were collected using precombusted, amber-colored glass bottles with Teflon-lined caps. All analyses were conducted at the Kiowa lab.
          Data were provided by the Kiowa lab manager as Excel spreadsheets.
          The charge balance was calculated as (cation sum - anion sum)/(cation sum + anion sum).
          The missing value indicator is one of the following codes:
          DNS=Data Not Submitted
          EQCL=Exceeds Quality Control Limits
          N/A=Not Applicable
          NP=Not Performed
          NSS=No Sample Submitted
          NV=Not Valid
          QNS=Quantity Not Sufficient
          Concentrations below the detection limit are shown as zero prior to 2007 and "u" subsequently.
          No samples were collected in 2001 and 2002 because of insufficient stream flow.
          The following variables were not measured, but were included for consistency with other data sets:
          acidity, alkalinity, tritium, and standard deviation of tritium

          measure of hydrogen ion concentration
        
        
          microsiemens per centimeter; used for concentration of ionized dissoved solids
        
        
          concentration of charge (on dissolved ions). A single ultiplier to SI is not possible; since conversion includes valence of ion; which can vary
        
        
          commonly used for concentration of some chemical constituents of natural water bodies; e.g.; nutrients. It has the same magnitude as micromolar; but micromolar can only be used for a dissolved constituent
        
        
          ratio of two quantities as parts per thousand (1:1000)
        
        
          Tritium unit; 1 tritium unit= 3.22 picocuries per liter
        
        
          concentration unit; sometimes used for pigments in natural waters
