      This data set was compiled by Anna Wright from raw data provided by Hope Humphries and the Arikaree lab manager. Metadata was created based off of similar mw water chem datasets (sad007) [ATW 3 September 2019]. Niwot metadata converted via script to EML[ATW 2019-09-17]

          The Soddie stream is located in the headwaters of the Como creek drainage, a tributary stream draining the SE Of Niwot Ridge. The sampling site for surface waters at the head of Como Creek is about 300 m down-gradient from the Soddie experimental site. Water samples were collected in polyethylene bottles (following the protocol of Campbell et al. 2000), soaked with deionized water overnight, and then rinsed copiously five times; bottles were further rinsed three times with sample water at the time of collection. Samples were collected ~10 cm below the water surface in turbulent areas where the water column was well mixed. All water samples were transported the same day as collection to our wet chemistry laboratory (Arikaree lab) and treated the same as melted snow samples. Samples for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were collected using precombusted, amber-colored glass bottles with Teflon-lined caps. All analyses were conducted at the Arikaree lab.
          Data were provided by the Arikaree lab manager as Excel spreadsheets.
          The charge balance was calculated as (cation sum - anion sum)/(cation sum + anion sum).
          The missing value indicator is one of the following codes:
          DNS=Data Not Submitted
          EQCL=Exceeds Quality Control Limits
          N/A=Not Applicable
          NP=Not Performed
          NSS=No Sample Submitted
          NV=Not Valid
          QNS=Quantity Not Sufficient
          The following variables were not measured, but were included for consistency with other data sets:
          acidity, alkalinity, tritium, and standard deviation of tritium

          concentration of charge (on dissolved ions). A single ultiplier to SI is not possible; since conversion includes valence of ion; which can vary
        
        
          commonly used for concentration of some chemical constituents of natural water bodies; e.g.; nutrients. It has the same magnitude as micromolar; but micromolar can only be used for a dissolved constituent
        
        
          ratio of two quantities as parts per thousand (1:1000)
        
        
          Tritium unit; 1 tritium unit= 3.22 picocuries per liter
        
        
          concentration unit; sometimes used for pigments in natural waters
